# üìä Advanced Sales Forecasting Dashboard

An advanced time series analysis and forecasting project applying state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning techniques to retail sales data.

## üîß Tools & Technologies
- Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Prophet, Scikit-learn
- Google Colab for cloud notebook execution
- Excel for interactive dashboarding using Power Query & PivotTables

## üìÅ Repository Contents
- `sales_forecasting_advanced.ipynb`: Fully documented Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and forecasting
- `sample_sales_data.csv`: Raw historical sales data with date/time stamps
- `forecasted_sales.csv`: Model-generated forecasted sales output
- `dashboard_advanced.xlsx`: Excel dashboard with interactive slicers, charts, and KPI summaries

## üß† What I Learned & Demonstrated
- Time series stationarity testing and transformation
- Feature engineering for temporal data (lags, rolling windows, seasonality)
- SARIMA & Prophet forecasting models with parameter tuning and validation
- Residual diagnostics and error analysis (RMSE, MAPE, AIC/BIC)
- Creating professional Excel dashboards with slicers and dynamic charts
- Exporting and integrating Python forecasts with Excel for business insights

## üöÄ Next Steps & Improvements
- Deploy model and dashboard as a Streamlit web app
- Automate data pipeline for real-time forecasting
- Extend to multivariate forecasting with external regressors (promotions, weather)
- Explore deep learning models (LSTM, Transformers) for complex patterns
